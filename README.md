# Portfolio

## Description

The objective of this project was to build a website to introduce myself as a potential web developer and showcase the projects I have completed. I built this project to give potential employers the opportunity to review my work and also significantly enhance my chances of landing a job as a Web developer. This site gives access to my Github profile, making it easy for potential employers to see what I have done.

This project was built with the front-end JavaScript library, *React*.
Working on this project has made me understand the importance of designing websites with a "Mobile-first" idealogy, ensuring that the website is viewed properly on smaller devices before enhancing to fit larger screen sizes.
