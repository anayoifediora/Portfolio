            <p>
                Hello! I am Mr. Kanayochi Ifediora, a budding Web developer. 
                I am married with two children and my interests include soccer, 
                basketball, chess, and a love for cars. One strange fact about 
                me, I love spotting Aeroplanes! I have a background in Chemical 
                Engineering, and I have also worked in Financial Services for a 
                long time, but I have recently developed an interest in Information 
                Technology and I am fascinated by it. I have decided to learn Web 
                development and this page contains a host of projects I have built.
            </p>
